## Self-Reflection:
I felt like I struggled a little bit at first to remember a lot of the techniques and skills that came with HTML and CSS.
I found myself having to look up how to make certain changes a lot, but I still got the work done. I hope I won't have to reference old material as much as I go on.
I know that the overall style of the website could be better, but I did was was required for the lab.
The work that was required of me got done and I fufilled all the requirements for the lab, and I made frequent commits.

### How long it took me to finish this? 
About 1.5 hours combined time
